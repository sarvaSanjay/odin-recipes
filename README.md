## An exercise to improve html skills while creating some amazing food.
In this project I intend to create a simple website that focuses on explaining a few of my favorite recipes using basic HTML tools.
## File structure ##
The project has three main components to its file structure. They are: an index page that acts as a default home page that contains a list of links to my favorite recipes; a recipes directory that contains a series of html pages each one being devoted towards explaining a single recipe and finally an images directory that contains images of my favorite foods that shall be displayed in each webpage.
## Recipes ##
I shall be explaining the following recipes:
* Fish clear noodle soup
* Pasta
* Cheese maggii
* Masala chai
These recipes shall not be focused on sophistication or hard work and shall rely rather on simplicity and ease- qualities that are important for student life.
